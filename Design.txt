What additional properties did you add to your models and why?

I included two more entities: Dice and Players. Since this is a multiplayer game, the players entity connects multiple users to a game.
This also made it easier to get a user's active games since I could search through the players database to find games they were in.
In turn, the dice enitity keeps track of players dice and is connected through a player key to a game. When the game is completed and
the dice total needs to get calculated, all the players could be found in a game, and all the dice for those players could be found.

What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?

It was a little tricky at first to come up with the most efficient schema, but in the end, I'm happy with the one I ended up using.
The one to many relationships between games, players, and dice made it straight forward to make get requests and calculations.
Since liars dice is such an important game of information, I would like to one day return and make email notifications for when a game
is created notifying users of what dice they have. Additionally, more controls to prevent users from abusing the game system is much
desired. For instance, there's nothing from preventing a user from playing a game against him or herself and falsifying a high score.

Another challenge was adding the "cancel game" feature. Just completely cancelling a game can lead to rage quits, and depending on the
circumstances, it's difficult figuring out if someone should be awarded score points or not. A better feature would be a drop player
option. This way the remaining players can keep playing the game and a winner can still be awarded points. 

Another desire would be to add OAuth when users want to make a move. It's much more secure than my simple system.
